# 📊 Week 2 Report – Water Quality Prediction

In Week 2, I developed the initial machine learning models for predicting water potability.

### ✔️ Work Done:
- Cleaned and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained two models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- Evaluated models using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
- Saved the better performing model (`logistic_model.pkl`) for future use.
- Prepared reusable Python scripts and improved notebook structure.

### 🔜 Next Steps:
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
- Try additional models like SVM and Gradient Boosting.
- Deploy model with a simple UI using Streamlit (Week 4).

# 💧 Water Quality Prediction - Week 2

This project aims to predict the potability of water based on various physicochemical properties using machine learning.

## ✅ Week 2 Progress
- Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Saved best model for later use.
- Project is now ready for hyperparameter tuning and deployment.

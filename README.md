# 💧 Water Quality Prediction - Week 1

This project aims to predict whether water is potable (safe to drink) using machine learning based on various physicochemical properties of water.

This Week 1 submission includes:
- Dataset collection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Project structure and documentation
- A main script to run basic data processing

## 📊 Dataset
Source: [Kaggle - Water Potability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)
Target Variable: `Potability` (0 = Not Safe, 1 = Safe)

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🏃 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with EDA
- `src/`: Python scripts
- `README.md`: Project overview
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages

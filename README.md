This project aims to predict the quality of water using machine learning algorithms by analyzing various physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and others. The goal is to classify water as safe or unsafe for consumption or use.

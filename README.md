# 💧 Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

Water is essential to life, and ensuring its quality is crucial for public health and environmental sustainability. This project predicts the **potability of water** using machine learning algorithms based on various physicochemical parameters like pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, etc.

The model classifies whether the water is **safe for drinking (potable)** or **not potable**, helping in early detection of unsafe water and supporting better decision-making for water treatment processes.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Predicts whether water is **safe or unsafe** for drinking.
* Implements **data preprocessing, feature selection**, and **model evaluation** techniques.
* Compares performance of multiple ML models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
* Visualizes key insights using **matplotlib and seaborn**.
* Achieves high accuracy and interpretability.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries Used**:

  * `pandas`, `numpy` – for data processing
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – for data visualization
  * `scikit-learn` – for ML modeling
* **Jupyter Notebook** – for development and visualization
